## What is WordWise Play?

WordWise Play is a classroom-ready web application that makes learning word families fun and interactive. Teachers can select specific word families (like -at, -an, -og) and conduct guided practice sessions where students identify onsets and rimes, building crucial phonemic awareness skills.

### Key Features

- **11 Word Families**: Comprehensive coverage of essential phonics patterns including -ad, -at, -an, -in, -og, -am, -ug, -op, -ight, -ack, and -ail
- **Randomized Practice**: Words are shuffled each session to prevent memorization and encourage true learning
- **Touch & Keyboard Ready**: Perfect for interactive whiteboards, tablets, or traditional computers
- **Large, Clear Text**: Optimized for classroom projection and group learning
- **No Setup Required**: Jump straight into teaching with instant access
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback and session completion tracking

### Perfect For
